# Authentication Security Improvements

## Overview

The mobile app now has comprehensive authentication security measures that properly integrate with your Django backend authentication system. All security issues have been addressed to ensure users can only access role-based screens when properly authenticated.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Authentication State Persistence ✅
- **Problem**: App didn't check if user was already logged in on startup
- **Solution**: Enhanced `SplashScreen` to check authentication status and automatically navigate to appropriate screen
- **Implementation**: Uses `checkAuthStatus()` to verify stored session and user role

### 2. Role-Based Navigation Security ✅
- **Problem**: Role state was lost on app restart, users could access wrong screens
- **Solution**: Enhanced navigation system with proper role-based routing
- **Implementation**: 
  - `RootNavigator` now properly manages role state
  - Each tab navigator (`MainTabs`, `DriverTabs`, `OwnerTabs`) includes authentication guards
  - Role verification happens on every navigation

### 3. Authentication Guards ✅
- **Problem**: Screens could be accessed without proper authentication
- **Solution**: Created `useAuth` hooks to protect screens
- **Implementation**:
  - `useRequireAuth`: Ensures user is authenticated
  - `useRequireRole`: Ensures user has specific role
  - Applied to all sensitive screens (`BookScreen`, `AccountDetailsScreen`, `TartanillaCarriagesScreen`, etc.)

### 4. Session Management ✅
- **Problem**: No session validation or automatic logout
- **Solution**: Enhanced session management with validation
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `validateSession()` function for backend validation
  - Enhanced `checkAuthStatus()` with better error handling
  - Automatic session cleanup on invalid tokens

### 5. Navigation Security ✅
- **Problem**: Users could navigate back to protected screens after logout
- **Solution**: Proper navigation stack reset on authentication changes
- **Implementation**:
  - Login uses `navigation.reset()` to prevent back navigation
  - Logout completely resets navigation stack to `Welcome` screen
  - Authentication guards redirect to appropriate screens

## New Files Created

### `src/hooks/useAuth.js`
Custom React hooks for authentication management:
- `useAuth()`: Core authentication state management
- `useRequireAuth(navigation)`: Requires authentication, redirects if not logged in
- `useRequireRole(requiredRoles, navigation)`: Requires specific roles

## Updated Files

### Core Authentication
- `src/services/authService.js`: Enhanced with session validation
- `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.js`: Improved navigation reset
- `src/navigation/RootNavigator.js`: Enhanced role-based routing

### Screen Protection
- `src/screens/splash/SplashScreen.js`: Authentication state check on startup
- `src/screens/main/MenuScreen.js`: Secure logout with navigation reset
- `src/screens/main/BookScreen.js`: Authentication guard
- `src/screens/main/AccountDetailsScreen.js`: Authentication guard  
- `src/screens/main/TartanillaCarriagesScreen.js`: Authentication guard

### Navigation
- `src/navigation/MainTabs.js`: Tourist role authentication
- `src/navigation/DriverTabs.js`: Driver role authentication  
- `src/navigation/OwnerTabs.js`: Owner role authentication

## How It Works

### App Startup Flow
1. **SplashScreen** checks authentication status
2. If authenticated: Navigate to appropriate role-based main screen
3. If not authenticated: Navigate to Welcome screen

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. Backend validates and returns user data with role
3. Session stored locally with role information
4. Navigation stack reset to prevent back navigation
5. Navigate to role-specific main screen

### Screen Access Control
1. Each protected screen uses authentication hooks
2. Hooks check authentication status on component mount
3. If not authenticated: Redirect to Welcome screen
4. If wrong role: Redirect to appropriate screen

### Logout Flow
1. Clear backend session (API call)
2. Clear local storage (tokens, user data)
3. Reset navigation stack completely
4. Navigate to Welcome screen

## Backend Integration

The mobile app correctly uses your Django backend authentication:

### Login Endpoint
```javascript
POST /api/auth/login/
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "allowed_roles": ["tourist", "driver", "owner"]  // Mobile roles only
}
```

### Session Management
- Stores `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and user data
- Validates sessions with backend when needed
- Handles token expiry gracefully

### Role-Based Access
- Only allows mobile roles: `tourist`, `driver`, `owner`
- Prevents admin access from mobile app
- Proper role verification on each screen

## Security Features

✅ **Authentication Required**: All sensitive screens require valid authentication
✅ **Role-Based Access**: Users only see screens appropriate for their role  
✅ **Session Validation**: Sessions validated with backend for critical operations
✅ **Secure Logout**: Complete session cleanup and navigation reset
✅ **Navigation Security**: No back navigation to protected screens after logout
✅ **State Persistence**: Authentication state maintained across app restarts
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and invalid sessions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login/Logout Flow**: Verify proper navigation and session management
2. **Role Switching**: Test different user roles see appropriate screens
3. **App Restart**: Ensure authentication state persists correctly
4. **Network Errors**: Test authentication with poor connectivity
5. **Session Expiry**: Verify automatic logout on token expiry
6. **Back Navigation**: Ensure no access to protected screens after logout

The mobile app now provides enterprise-level authentication security while maintaining a smooth user experience.
