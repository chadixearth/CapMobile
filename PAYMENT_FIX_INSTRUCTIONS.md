# Payment Status Fix - Testing Instructions

## Problem
The payment completion API is returning a 500 error, preventing the booking status from updating to 'paid' after payment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging to `payment_completion.py`
- Added debug endpoint to check booking status
- Better error handling and traceback information

### 2. Test Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/payment/complete/` - Test if endpoint is accessible
- `GET /api/debug/booking/{booking_id}/` - Check current booking status
- `POST /api/debug/booking/{booking_id}/` - Manually update booking status for testing

### 3. UI Fixes (Already Applied)
- Driver screen now properly handles 'paid' status
- Tourist screen shows payment completion status
- Better notifications and status messages

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test the API Endpoints
```bash
# Test if payment completion endpoint is accessible
curl http://192.168.3.23:8000/api/payment/complete/

# Check current booking status
curl http://192.168.3.23:8000/api/debug/booking/03502004-c8d8-428b-9287-41214467e5b1/
```

### Step 2: Run the Test Script
```bash
# Navigate to the mobile app directory
cd C:\Users\richa\OneDrive\Desktop\Capstone-Mobile\CapMobile

# Run the comprehensive test
node comprehensive_payment_test.js
```

### Step 3: Manual Testing
1. **Tourist Side:**
   - Book a tour package
   - Wait for driver to accept
   - Go to payment screen
   - Complete payment
   - Check if status shows "Payment Complete"

2. **Driver Side:**
   - Accept a booking
   - Wait for tourist to pay
   - Check ongoing bookings
   - Should see "Start Trip" button (not "Waiting for Payment")

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Tourist pays → 500 error
- ❌ Driver still sees "Waiting for Payment"
- ❌ Tourist doesn't see payment confirmation

### After Fix:
- ✅ Tourist pays → Status updates to 'paid'
- ✅ Driver sees "Start Trip" button
- ✅ Tourist sees "Payment Complete" status
- ✅ Driver receives notification about payment

## Troubleshooting

### If 500 Error Persists:
1. Check Django server logs for detailed error
2. Verify Supabase connection is working
3. Check if 'bookings' table exists and has correct columns
4. Verify API endpoint is properly registered in urls.py

### If Status Doesn't Update:
1. Check database permissions
2. Verify booking ID exists
3. Check if Supabase RLS policies allow updates
4. Use debug endpoint to manually test updates

## Files Modified
- `api/payment_completion.py` - Enhanced error handling
- `api/debug_booking.py` - New debug endpoint
- `api/urls.py` - Added debug endpoint
- `src/screens/main/DriverBookScreen.js` - Fixed driver UI
- `src/screens/main/BookScreen.js` - Fixed tourist UI
- `src/screens/main/PaymentScreen.js` - Better error handling

## Next Steps
1. Run the test script to identify the exact 500 error
2. Fix any database/permission issues found
3. Test the complete payment flow end-to-end
4. Verify both driver and tourist see correct status
