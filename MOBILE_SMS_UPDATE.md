# Mobile App SMS Verification Update

## Overview
Updated the TarTrack mobile app to use SMS verification instead of email verification to match the backend system changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Registration Screen Updates
**File**: `src/screens/auth/RegistrationScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated approval messages to mention SMS notifications instead of email
- Changed "You will receive an email confirmation" to "You will receive an SMS notification"
- Updated Terms & Conditions text to reflect SMS-based credential delivery
- Changed "login credentials via email" to "login credentials via SMS to your registered phone number"

**Key Message Updates**:
```javascript
// Before
`Your ${role} registration has been submitted for admin approval. You will receive an email confirmation once approved.`

// After  
`Your ${role} registration has been submitted for admin approval. You will receive an SMS notification once approved.`
```

### 2. Auth Service Updates
**File**: `src/services/authService.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated JSDoc comments to reflect SMS-based notification system
- Added phone number validation for driver/owner registrations
- Enhanced documentation to specify SMS notifications for approvals

**Key Updates**:
- Added phone number requirement validation for driver/owner roles
- Updated function documentation to mention SMS notifications
- Added validation error for missing phone numbers

## Backend Compatibility

The mobile app now matches the backend SMS notification system:

### Registration Flow
1. **Tourist Registration**: Direct registration with password (no SMS needed)
2. **Driver/Owner Registration**: 
   - Requires phone number for SMS notifications
   - Admin approval triggers SMS with credentials
   - Password can be provided or auto-generated

### SMS Integration
- Backend uses Twilio for SMS delivery
- Phone numbers are validated during registration
- Approval/rejection notifications sent via SMS
- Credentials delivered securely via SMS
