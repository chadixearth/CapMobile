# Payment Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Payment Completion API Error (500)**
**Problem**: The mobile app was getting a 500 error when calling the payment completion endpoint.

**Root Cause**: Missing authentication headers and improper error handling.

**Fix**: 
- Added proper JWT authentication to API calls
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added payment method tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/main/PaymentScreen.js` - Added authentication headers
- `api/payment_completion.py` - Added payment method field

### 2. **Booking Status Flow Bug**
**Problem**: Booking status wasn't properly transitioning from `driver_assigned` → `paid` → `in_progress` → `completed`.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent status checks and missing payment_status validation.

**Fix**:
- Fixed status transition logic in booking API
- Added proper payment_status validation for trip start
- Updated status checks to be more precise

**Files Modified**:
- `api/booking.py` - Fixed start_booking validation

### 3. **Multiple Payment Prevention**
**Problem**: Tourist could pay multiple times for the same booking, causing confusion.

**Root Cause**: No payment completion tracking in the UI.

**Fix**:
- Added payment completion state tracking
- Added booking status checking on screen load
- Disabled payment buttons when already paid
- Added success card for completed payments

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/main/PaymentScreen.js` - Added payment tracking and UI states

### 4. **Poor UX and Missing Status Indicators**
**Problem**: No clear indication of payment status, trip progress, or proper button states.

**Root Cause**: Missing UI states for different booking phases.

**Fix**:

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/main/BookScreen.js` - Enhanced UI states and status indicators

### 5. **Test Code Removal**
**Problem**: Payment screen was using simulation code instead of actual payment processing.

**Root Cause**: Test code left in production.

**Fix**:
- Removed simulation code
- Replaced with actual API calls
- Added proper error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/main/PaymentScreen.js` - Replaced simulation with real API calls
