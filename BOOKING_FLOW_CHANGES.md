# Booking Flow Changes - Payment After Driver Acceptance

## Overview
Changed the booking flow so tourists only pay after a driver accepts their booking request, instead of paying upfront when requesting a booking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Request Booking Screen (`requestBookingScreen.js`)
- **Before**: Tourist fills form → Goes to Payment → Booking created after payment
- **After**: Tourist fills form → Booking created immediately without payment
- Changed button text from "Book" to "Submit Request"
- Updated success modal to indicate this is a request, not confirmed booking
- Modified flow to create booking directly instead of navigating to payment

### 2. Booking Service (`requestBooking.js`)
- Changed initial booking status from `'waiting_for_driver'` to `'pending'`
- Updated fallback logic to handle status validation

### 3. Accept Booking Service (`acceptBooking.js`)
- Updated available bookings filter to look for `'pending'` status instead of `'waiting_for_driver'`
- Enhanced notification to tourists to specifically mention payment is required after acceptance

### 4. Book Screen (`BookScreen.js`)
- Added `canPayForBooking()` function to check if booking needs payment
- Added "Pay Now" button for confirmed bookings that haven't been paid
- Added `handlePayForBooking()` function to navigate to payment screen

### 5. Payment Screen (`PaymentScreen.js`)
- Updated to handle both new bookings (legacy) and existing confirmed bookings
- Modified `createBookingAfterPayment()` to check if booking already exists

### 6. Booking Confirmation Screen (`BookingConfirmationScreen.js`)
- Updated messages to reflect new flow where payment happens after driver acceptance
- Changed "What's Next?" steps to mention payment after driver acceptance

## New Flow

### Tourist Side:
1. **Submit Request**: Tourist fills booking form and submits (status: `pending`)
2. **Wait for Driver**: Tourist receives confirmation that request was submitted
3. **Driver Accepts**: Tourist gets notification that driver accepted (status: `confirmed`)
4. **Payment Required**: Tourist can now pay through "Pay Now" button in bookings
5. **Payment Complete**: Booking is fully confirmed (status: `paid`)

### Driver Side:
1. **See Requests**: Drivers see bookings with `pending` status
2. **Accept Booking**: Driver accepts, status changes to `confirmed`
3. **Tourist Notified**: Tourist gets notification with payment reminder
4. **Wait for Payment**: Driver waits for tourist to complete payment
5. **Start Tour**: Once paid, driver can start the tour

## Benefits
- Tourists don't pay until they know a driver is available
- Reduces risk of payment without service
- Better user experience with confirmed driver before payment
- Maintains existing payment infrastructure

## Status Flow
```
pending → confirmed → paid → in_progress → completed
   ↑         ↑         ↑
Tourist   Driver    Tourist
Request   Accepts   Pays
```
