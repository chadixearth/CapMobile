# Backend JSON Truncation Issue - CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

## Problem Identified
The Django backend is sending **truncated JSON responses** that are causing "JSON Parse error: Unexpected end of input" in the mobile app.

## Evidence
- Login API response is exactly 81 characters but gets cut off mid-string
- Expected: `{"success": false, "error": "Invalid email or password.", "error_type": "credentials"}`
- Actual: `{"success": false, "error": "Invalid email or password.", "error_type": "credenti`
- This happens consistently across different requests

## Root Cause
The Django backend is not sending complete JSON responses. This could be caused by:

1. **Middleware issues** - Response middleware cutting off responses
2. **WSGI server configuration** - Buffer size limitations
3. **Django settings** - Response streaming issues
4. **Network proxy/load balancer** - Truncating responses

## Backend Fixes Needed (Django)

### 1. Check Django Middleware
Look for any custom middleware that might be modifying responses:
```python
# In settings.py, check MIDDLEWARE list
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Look for any custom middleware that might truncate responses
]
```

### 2. Check WSGI Configuration
Ensure the WSGI server isn't truncating responses:
```python
# If using gunicorn, check worker settings
# If using Django dev server, this shouldn't happen
```

### 3. Check Response Headers
Ensure Content-Length headers are correct:
```python
# In your login view, ensure proper response handling
from django.http import JsonResponse

def login_view(request):
    response_data = {
        "success": False,
        "error": "Invalid email or password.",
        "error_type": "credentials"
    }
    return JsonResponse(response_data)
```

### 4. Add Response Debugging
Add logging to see what's being sent:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def login_view(request):
    # ... your login logic ...
    response_data = {...}
    
    # Log the full response before sending
    logger.info(f"Sending response: {json.dumps(response_data)}")
    logger.info(f"Response length: {len(json.dumps(response_data))}")
    
    return JsonResponse(response_data)
```

## Mobile App Workaround (Temporary)
I've added a temporary workaround in the mobile app that:
- Detects truncated JSON responses
- Reconstructs common error responses
- Provides meaningful error messages to users

However, **the backend MUST be fixed** as this workaround only handles simple cases.

## Testing the Fix
After fixing the backend, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong","allowed_roles":["tourist"]}' \
  http://192.168.8.103:8000/api/auth/login/
```

The response should be complete JSON, not truncated.

## Priority: CRITICAL
This issue affects all API responses and must be fixed immediately for the app to function properly.
